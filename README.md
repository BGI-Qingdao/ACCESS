## 🧬 Project Overview
**ACCESS** is a specialized open-source Python package in the field of biomanufacturing. It aims to offer high-precision EC number prediction for the rational design of industrial enzymes, screening of functional proteins, and enzyme reaction optimization using MIT license. By combining 3D protein structural features, side-chain features, and residue-level Rosetta energy, it uses a hybrid graph neural network architecture. Based on hierarchical contrastive learning and multi-label adaptive fine-tuning, it predicts protein functions. Through a topology-aware gradient attention mechanism, it precisely locates function - critical residues. This approach pioneers a multimodal feature fusion graph neural network architecture and an interpretable AI algorithm (“Activity Existence - EC Prediction - Rational Design”), surmounting the limitations of conventional tools.
